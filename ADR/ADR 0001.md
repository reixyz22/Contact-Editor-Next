# ADR 0001: Choose a Web Framework for Contact Management System

## Context
The goal is to build a website that allows users to store, retrieve, and edit contact details. The application should be efficient, scalable, and maintainable. We are considering using either `Remix` or `Next.js` as the web development framework.

## Decision
We will use `[Remix/Next.js]` as the web development framework for our project.

## Consequences
### If we choose Remix:
- **Pros**:
  -Seems to advertise itself as extremely fast with no loading times
  
  -implied preference of Mentor /product owner, Ashish
  
  -unqiue routing system
- **Cons**:
  - Less community and third-party support compared to Next.js. (althought for our purposes a simple tutorial which is on the website should be plenty)

### If we choose Next.js:
- **Pros**:
  - Large community and extensive ecosystem; might have better imports 
  - More comprehensive documentation and tutorials available, which could help us a lot.
- **Cons**:
  - Might require additional configuration for complex data handling scenarios. Is this true? GPT put this one..

## NEW APROACH
This might be overly simple, but we will put some time into the tutorial section of each framework, then once we develop a preference we will attempt to articulate why. 

## Rationale
We've decided to use Remix.run, in the interest of being time effcient; at the cost of not really investigating next.js thoroughly.
